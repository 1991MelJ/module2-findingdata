# Going Further
- use Ed Summer's [TWARC](https://github.com/shawngraham/twarc) to grab, archive, share, inflate, and visualize tweets
- convert JSON to CSV with [this tool](http://konklone.io/json/)
- use R to grab resources from [dp.la](http://dp.la) with this wee R script on my [gists](https://gist.github.com/shawngraham/0907ab2c2185cfe9f91b)

### Did you know?
- you can drop geojson into github, and [github will turn it into a map](https://github.com/shawngraham/twarc/blob/master/ottawa-museum-tweets.geojson)
- twarc can be used to extract the coordinates from tweets, and turn them into geojson data.
